## 5. Data Cleaning and Preparation
The cleaning process involved:

Removing redundant spaces and fixing 

Ensuring gender values were consistently formatted (e.g., Male/Female), those not specified were tagged "Unspecified".

## 6. Exploratory Data Analysis
### a. Gender Representation
Count by Gender shows noticeable disparities across departments and regions.

Some departments are male-dominated while others show a more balanced distribution.

### b. Salary Analysis
Average Salary by Gender and Average Salary by Gender & Dept highlight gaps in pay equity.

Males tend to earn slightly more on average, especially in senior roles or specific departments.

### c. Compliance with Salary Policy
The Minimum Salary Rule ($90,000) sheet reveals a few employees were either close to or below this threshold â€” a potential policy violation.

### d. Bonus Distribution
Total Bonus Payout by Region suggests regional differences in reward distribution.

Some regions reward employees more generously, which may be influenced by revenue or team performance.

### e. Dashboard Overview
The Dashboard sheet summarizes KPIs like gender ratio, average salary, and total headcount, providing a quick executive snapshot.

## Advisory Summary for Stakeholders and Decision Makers
The analysis of Palmoria Groupâ€™s employee data reveals key insights that should inform immediate and strategic HR and operational decisions:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Address Gender Imbalance
There is clear underrepresentation of women in several departments and regions. Proactive steps like targeted recruitment, mentorship programs, and internal promotions can help close this gap.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Ensure Pay Equity
The average salary for male employees is consistently higher than for female employees across departments. Conduct a full pay equity audit and adjust discrepancies where unjustified.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Enforce Salary Compliance
A few employees earn below the company's minimum salary policy of $90,000. Immediate review and adjustment are necessary to align with policy and maintain fairness.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Standardize Bonus Distribution
Bonus payouts vary significantly by region. Create a more transparent and performance-based framework to ensure consistency and motivation across all teams.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Leverage Dashboard Insights
Use the existing dashboard for continuous monitoring of gender ratios, salary bands, and departmental performance. Regularly update and review these metrics to track progress and accountability.

### Next Steps:

Initiate a gender equity task force

Set targets for balanced hiring and pay adjustments

Review regional bonus policies

Maintain monthly HR analytics reports

These actions will not only improve fairness and compliance but also boost morale, retention, and employer reputation.
